HUMAN BLOG POST TEMPLATE - Starlight Format

Design Philosophy Alignment:
- Simplicity First: Show simple solutions before optimizations
- Learning in Public: Document real mistakes and breakthroughs
- Developer-Skeptical: Include real code with verification links
- Show Don't Tell: Code examples before explanations

TARGET: Developers following the learning journey
GOAL: Share authentic learning experiences with practical insights

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Card } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

[Opening paragraph that captures the day's main challenge or discovery. Be authentic about
confusion, breakthroughs, or "aha!" moments.]

## The Challenge

[What specific problem were you trying to solve? Set up the context honestly - include what you
didn't understand at first.]

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What I Thought">
    ```rust // My initial (possibly wrong) approach // Show the naive or incorrect solution ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="What Actually Works">
    ```rust // ferrisdb-storage/src/[component]/[file].rs:[lines] // The correct implementation with
    file reference ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Seeking Understanding

[Share the actual dialogue or exploration process. Be honest about what confused you.]

**My question**: "[Actual question you asked]"

**What I learned**: [The explanation that made it click]

<Aside type="tip" title="Key Insight">
  [The main conceptual breakthrough in simple terms]
</Aside>

## The Implementation Journey

### First Attempt

```rust
// Show your actual first attempt, even if it didn't compile
// Include the error messages if they're instructive
```

**What went wrong**: [Explain the issue honestly]

### Working Solution

```rust
// ferrisdb-storage/src/[component]/[file].rs:[lines]
// The actual working code from FerrisDB
```

**Why this works**:

- [Key understanding point 1]
- [Key understanding point 2]
- [Trade-off or limitation acknowledged]

## Real Learning Moments

<Card title="💡 Main Takeaway" icon="star">
  [The primary thing you learned today - make it actionable for other developers]
</Card>

**Other insights**:

- 🔍 [Discovery about Rust or databases]
- 🛠️ [Practical implementation detail]
- ⚠️ [Gotcha or common mistake to avoid]

## Testing My Understanding

```bash
# Commands I ran to verify the implementation
cargo test memtable_basics
cargo run --example simple_operations

# Output that confirmed it worked
[Include actual output if meaningful]
```

<Aside type="caution" title="What's Still Unclear">
  [Be honest about what you still don't fully understand - this is learning in public]
</Aside>

## Looking Ahead

**Tomorrow's challenge**: [What you plan to tackle next]

**Questions still brewing**:

- [Unresolved question 1]
- [Concept you want to explore deeper]

**Today's Stats** (optional):

- Lines of code: [actual number]
- Tests written: [count]
- Compilation attempts: [be honest!]
- Coffee consumed: [for personality]

**Confidence level**: [honest assessment]/10
