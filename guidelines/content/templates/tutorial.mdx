TUTORIAL TEMPLATE - Building FerrisDB Step by Step

Design Philosophy:
- One component at a time
- One new Rust concept per step
- Test everything as we go
- Compare to familiar languages
- Celebrate progress

IMPORTANT: Final code MUST match real FerrisDB implementation

## What We're Building Today

[Clear, visual explanation of the component we're building. Include a simple diagram if helpful.]

### The Real-World Problem

[Explain the problem in terms CRUD developers understand. Use analogies from web development.]

**Example scenario**: [Concrete example showing why this component is needed]

### What You'll Learn

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="🦀 New Rust Concepts" icon="code">
    - **[Concept 1]**: [One-line description] - **[Concept 2]**: [One-line description] - **[Concept
    3]**: [One-line description]
  </Card>

  <Card title="📚 Database Knowledge" icon="database">
    - **[DB Concept 1]**: [Why it matters] - **[DB Concept 2]**: [Real-world impact]
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Prerequisites

<Card title="Before You Start" icon="information">

**Required Tutorials**:

- ✅ [Tutorial 1: Title] - We'll use [concepts] from this
- ✅ [Tutorial 2: Title] - We'll build on [concepts]

**Concepts You Already Know**:

- Rust: [List from tracking system]
- Database: [List from tracking system]

**Time Needed**: ~[X] minutes

</Card>

## Setup

Let's create our workspace for this component:

```bash
# If following along in your own project
cargo new --lib ferrisdb-tutorial-[N]
cd ferrisdb-tutorial-[N]

# Add dependencies we'll need
cargo add [dependencies]
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Following along in the FerrisDB repo? The final code is in `ferrisdb-storage/src/[component]/`
</Aside>

## Let's Build!

### Step 1: [First Small Goal]

[Explain what we're doing and why - keep it simple and clear]

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Write This Code">
    ```rust // Start with the simplest possible version // Introduce only ONE new concept [Initial
    code] ```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="Understanding the Code">
  Let's break this down: ```rust // [Line-by-line explanation] ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="If You Know JavaScript">
  ```javascript // In JavaScript, you might write: [JS equivalent] ``` **Key differences**: -
  [Difference 1] - [Difference 2]
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="If You Know Python">
    ```python # In Python, you might write: [Python equivalent] ``` **Key differences**: -
    [Difference 1] - [Difference 2]
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note" title="🦀 New Rust Concept: [Concept Name]">

[Clear explanation for CRUD developers. Use analogies to web development concepts they know.]

**Think of it like**: [Analogy to something familiar]

**Why Rust does this**: [Brief explanation of the benefit]

#### Test What We Built

Let's prove our code works:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_step_1() {
        // Arrange
        [setup code]

        // Act
        [action code]

        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected);
    }
}
```

Run it:

```bash
cargo test test_step_1
```

<Aside type="tip" title="✅ Success!">
  Great! You just [what they accomplished]. The test proves our code works correctly.
</Aside>

### Step 2: [Next Incremental Addition]

Now let's [what we're adding and why].

<Aside type="caution" title="📚 Database Concept: [Concept Name]">

We covered **[concept]** in [Tutorial X: Title](link). Quick reminder:

[One-sentence refresher of the concept]

Need a deeper refresher? Check [Tutorial X, Step Y](link).

</Aside>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Evolve Our Code">
    ```rust // Building on Step 1, we add: [Code showing the evolution] ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="What Changed">
    Here's what we added: ```diff + [New lines] - [Removed lines] ``` This change [explains why].
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

[Continue pattern for each step...]

### Step N: Matching Real FerrisDB

Let's see how our tutorial code compares to the real implementation:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Our Tutorial Code">
    ```rust // What we built step-by-step [Final tutorial version] ```
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="Real FerrisDB Code">
  ```rust // ferrisdb-storage/src/[component]/[file].rs:[lines] [Actual FerrisDB implementation] ```
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Key Differences">
    The real implementation adds: - **Error handling**: [Explanation] - **Optimizations**: [What and
    why] - **Additional features**: [List them] These are important for production but would have
    made learning harder!
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Final Test: Integration

Let's test our complete component:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_complete_component() {
    // Test the full functionality
    [Comprehensive test]
}
```
