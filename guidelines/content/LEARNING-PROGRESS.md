# FerrisDB Tutorial Learning Progress Dashboard

_Central dashboard for tracking tutorial progress and concept coverage_

## 🎯 Tutorial Series Overview

**Goal**: Teach CRUD developers to build a complete storage engine from scratch, introducing Rust and database concepts gradually.

**Teaching Philosophy**:

- 🏗️ One component at a time
- 🦀 One new Rust concept per step
- 📚 Connect to real-world database problems
- 🧪 Test everything as we go
- 🎉 Celebrate progress
