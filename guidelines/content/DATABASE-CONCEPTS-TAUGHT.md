## 🔄 Maintenance Instructions

### When Writing a New Tutorial

1. **Before starting**: Review which concepts are already taught
2. **Plan concepts**: Choose 2-4 database concepts that build on previous knowledge
3. **During writing**:
   - Introduce concepts with real-world analogies
   - Explain WHY before HOW
   - Show impact with concrete examples
4. **After completion**: Update this tracker

### Format for Updates

```markdown
### Tutorial N: [Title]

_Status: [PLANNED|DRAFT|PUBLISHED]_

**Introduced**:

- ✅ Concept name - Real-world impact explained
- ✅ Another concept - Why it matters for CRUD apps

**Reinforced**:

- ✅ Previous concept (from Tutorial X) - New context

**File**: `tutorials/NN-tutorial-name.mdx`
```

## 🎯 Teaching Philosophy

### Make It Relatable

- **Web App Analogies**: "Like Redis but we build it"
- **Real Problems**: "What happens when the server crashes?"
- **Concrete Examples**: "An e-commerce order that must not be lost"

### Build Understanding Gradually

1. **Start Simple**: Key-value is just a HashMap
2. **Add Complexity**: What if power fails?
3. **Introduce Trade-offs**: Fast writes vs fast reads
4. **Show Solutions**: How real databases solve this

### Connect to CRUD Experience

- "You know database transactions from Rails/Django"
- "Like database migrations but for storage format"
- "Similar to Redis caching but persistent"
