# FerrisDB Development Guidelines

Welcome to the FerrisDB development guidelines! These documents contain all the standards, processes, and best practices for contributing to FerrisDB.

## 📜 Governance

**IMPORTANT**: See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for how we maintain these guidelines. It serves as our constitution for information architecture and documentation standards.

## 🚨 Before You Commit

**MANDATORY for ALL contributors**:

### 1. Format ALL markdown/MDX changes:

```bash
prettier --write "**/*.md" "**/*.mdx"
```

### 2. Build Starlight if you touched ferrisdb-docs/:

```bash
cd ferrisdb-docs && npm run build
```

**Both are as critical as running `cargo fmt` for Rust code. CI will fail if skipped!**

## Getting Started

1. **New Contributors**: Start with [Code Style](development/code-style.md) and [Git Workflow](workflow/git-workflow.md)
2. **Content Writers**: Review [Blogging Guidelines](content/blogging.md) or relevant article formats
3. **Core Developers**: Familiarize yourself with [Architecture Decisions](technical/architecture.md) and [System Invariants](technical/invariants.md)

## Our Human-AI Workflow

FerrisDB demonstrates a specific collaboration pattern:

1. **Human assigns task**: Clear direction with context
2. **Claude implements**: Complete solution with tests
3. **Human reviews**: Questions, optimization ideas, edge cases
4. **Claude iterates**: Improvements based on feedback
5. **Together refine**: Until both are satisfied
6. **PR & merge**: Clear commits and documentation

This workflow is documented honestly in our blog posts, showing real conversations and actual development progress.

## Project Overview

FerrisDB is an educational project where a CRUD developer and an AI (Claude) are building a distributed database from scratch. The goal is not to create another production database, but to document the journey of learning database internals and Rust through building one.

**What makes us unique**: We're the only project transparently documenting every step of human-AI collaboration in building complex systems software.

## Key Principles

1. **Journey Over Destination**: The process of building matters more than the final product
2. **Educational First**: Every decision should make learning easier
3. **Radical Transparency**: Document real progress, real mistakes, real learning
4. **Factual Content**: Clearly distinguish what's built vs. what's planned
5. **Story-Driven**: Technical content needs narrative context
6. **Quality Code**: Follow Rust best practices and idioms
7. **Real Collaboration**: Show actual human-AI workflow, not idealized version
8. **No Premature Documentation**: Don't document features that don't exist

## Guidelines as Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: These guidelines serve as the authoritative source of truth for all FerrisDB development:

- **Design Decisions**: All architectural choices, algorithms, and technical approaches are documented in the [Technical Architecture](technical/) section
- **Content Creation**: Any blog posts, articles, or documentation must align with the standards and decisions documented here
- **Implementation**: Code must follow the patterns and principles established in these guidelines
- **Evolution**: Guidelines can and should be updated when we discover better approaches, but changes must be deliberate and documented

When writing any content or code:

1. Always reference these guidelines first
2. Ensure consistency with documented decisions
3. Update guidelines if a better approach is discovered
4. Never contradict established patterns without updating the guidelines

This ensures consistency across the entire project and provides a single, reliable reference for all contributors.
