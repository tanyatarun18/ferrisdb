# Technical Guidelines

Technical architecture and implementation guidelines for the FerrisDB project.

**Purpose**: Index of all technical guidelines covering architecture decisions, system design, and implementation standards.

## Core Architecture

### [Architecture Guidelines](architecture.md)

Core architectural principles and design decisions for FerrisDB, including:

- High-level system architecture
- Component responsibilities
- Design patterns and principles
- Technology choices and rationale
- Future architecture evolution

### [Storage Engine Guidelines](storage-engine.md)

Detailed guidelines for implementing FerrisDB's storage engine components:

- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) design
- MemTable implementation with Skip List
- SSTable format and operations
- Compaction strategies
- Key encoding and ordering

## Quality Attributes

### [Performance Guidelines](performance.md)

Standards and best practices for performance optimization:

- Benchmarking requirements
- Performance targets by component
- Optimization techniques
- Memory and CPU efficiency
- Concurrent operation guidelines

### [Security Guidelines](security.md)

Security practices and requirements for FerrisDB:

- Input validation standards
- Resource limit enforcement
- Secure coding practices
- Dependency security
- Future security considerations

### [System Invariants](invariants.md)

Critical system properties that must be maintained:

- Data consistency guarantees
- Ordering requirements
- Concurrency invariants
- Error handling principles
- System state transitions
