<Aside type="tip" title="Not Another Database">
  We're not building a database to compete with PostgreSQL. We're documenting the journey of
  learning how PostgreSQL works by building our own. If you need a database, use PostgreSQL. If you
  want to understand databases, join us!

## The Unique Experiment

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="👨‍💻 Human Learning" icon="user">
    A CRUD developer with no systems programming experience learning database internals through building
  </Card>

<Card title="🤖 AI Teaching" icon="robot">
  Claude AI implementing features and explaining concepts, learning to teach through iteration
</Card>

<Card title="📖 Public Journey" icon="megaphone">
  Every conversation, every mistake, every "aha!" moment documented in our blog
</Card>

  <Card title="🛠️ Real Code" icon="code">
    Actual working implementations, not toy examples - see exactly how databases work
  </Card>

## Current Reality Check

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What Works Today">
    <Badge text="HONEST STATUS" variant="success" />
    
    - ✅ **WAL Implementation** - Crash recovery actually works!
    - ✅ **Concurrent Skip List** - Real lock-free data structure
    - ✅ **SSTable Writer & Reader** - Can persist and read sorted data
    - ✅ **Blog & Tutorials** - Learn alongside us
    
    [See detailed status →](/status/)
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="What Doesn't Exist">
  <Badge text="NOT BUILT YET" variant="caution" />- ❌ **No Server** - Can't run FerrisDB - ❌ **No
  Storage Engine** - Components not connected - ❌ **No Queries** - Can't get/put data - ❌ **No
  Distribution** - Single node only We're building in public - watch it happen!
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="The Journey So Far">
    <Stats />
    
    Each day brings new learning:
    
    - Day 1: "Just use RocksDB" → "Let's build it!"
    - Day 2: Linear search → Proper algorithms
    - Day 3: Fiction writing → Accuracy focus
    - Day 4: Guidelines chaos → Governance system
