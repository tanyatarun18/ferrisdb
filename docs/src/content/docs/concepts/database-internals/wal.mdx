How Write-Ahead Logs ensure data durability and enable crash recovery in database systems.

**Difficulty:** 📗 Beginner • **Reading time:** 15 minutes

## The Problem & Why It Matters

Imagine you're running an e-commerce website. A customer completes their order, sees the "Order
Successful!" message, and then... your server crashes. When it restarts, is their order still there?
Or did it vanish into the digital void?

This is the fundamental durability problem that every database must solve. Without proper crash
recovery, you risk:

<Aside type="danger" title="Real-world nightmares for CRUD developers">
  - **Lost transactions**: Customer paid but order disappeared - **Inconsistent data**:
  Half-completed updates that corrupt your database - **Angry users**: "I know I updated my profile,
  where did my changes go?" - **Business impact**: Lost sales, refunds, and damaged reputation
</Aside>

The problem is that computers use two types of storage:

1. **RAM (Memory)**: Super fast but disappears when power is lost
2. **Disk (Storage)**: Slower but survives power loss

If your database only writes to memory for speed, all data is lost on crash. If it writes to disk
for every operation, it becomes painfully slow. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) solves this dilemma
elegantly.

## Conceptual Overview

### The Core Idea

Write-Ahead Logging follows a simple principle:

<Card title="WAL Core Principle" icon="information">
  "Write changes to a log file BEFORE updating the actual data"
</Card>

**Think of it like a restaurant's order system:**

1. **Taking the order** (WAL write): Waiter writes order on paper first
2. **Kitchen preparation** (Memory update): Cook starts preparing the meal
3. **Order tracking** (Recovery): If cook forgets, the written order still exists

Even if the kitchen catches fire (system crash), the written orders survive, and a new cook can
continue where the previous one left off.

### Visual Architecture

```text
User Request → WAL (Disk) → MemTable (RAM) → SSTable (Disk)
      ↓           ↓              ↓
   "Success"   Durability    Fast Access    Long-term Storage
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Key WAL Principles">
  1. **Write-ahead**: Log first, update data structures second 2. **Sequential writes**: Appending
  to log is fast (like writing in a journal) 3. **Recovery guarantee**: Can reconstruct exact state
  from log
</Aside>

## Real-World Analogy: Bank Transactions

Let's understand WAL through a familiar example - ATM withdrawals:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Without WAL">

    ```text
    1. Customer withdraws $100
    2. Update balance in memory: $1000 → $900
    3. Power failure! 💥
    4. Server restarts
    5. Balance shows $1000 (memory lost)
    6. Customer has cash but account shows no withdrawal!
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With WAL">

    ```text
    1. Customer withdraws $100
    2. Write to WAL: "Account 123: -$100 at 2:30 PM"
    3. Update balance in memory: $1000 → $900
    4. Power failure! 💥
    5. Server restarts
    6. Read WAL: "Oh, there was a $100 withdrawal"
    7. Replay transaction: $1000 → $900
    8. Balance correctly shows $900
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## FerrisDB Implementation

Let's see how FerrisDB implements WAL:

### WAL Entry Structure

```rust
// ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/log_entry.rs
pub struct LogEntry {
    pub sequence_number: u64,  // Unique ID for ordering
    pub key: Vec<u8>,         // What was changed
    pub value: Option<Vec<u8>>, // New value (None = delete)
    pub timestamp: u64,       // When it happened
}
```

### Writing to WAL

```rust
// Simplified from FerrisDB code
pub fn append(&mut self, entry: &LogEntry) -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Serialize the entry
    let serialized = bincode::serialize(entry)?;

    // 2. Write length prefix (so we know where entries start/end)
    self.writer.write_u32(serialized.len() as u32)?;

    // 3. Write the actual data
    self.writer.write_all(&serialized)?;

    // 4. Force to disk (fsync) - THIS IS CRITICAL!
    self.writer.sync_all()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The `sync_all()` call is crucial! It forces the OS to actually write data to disk instead of just
  buffering it. Without this, your "durable" writes might still be in OS buffers when a crash
  happens.
</Aside>

### Recovery Process

```rust
// How FerrisDB recovers after a crash
pub fn recover(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<LogEntry>> {
    let mut entries = Vec::new();

    loop {
        // Read entry length
        let len = match self.reader.read_u32() {
            Ok(len) => len,
            Err(_) => break, // End of log
        };

        // Read entry data
        let mut buffer = vec![0; len as usize];
        self.reader.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;

        // Deserialize and collect
        let entry: LogEntry = bincode::deserialize(&buffer)?;
        entries.push(entry);
    }

    // Replay all entries to reconstruct state
    for entry in &entries {
        self.apply_to_memtable(entry)?;
    }

    Ok(entries)
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Write Performance" icon="rocket">
    - **Sequential writes**: 100-500 MB/s
    - **Latency**: 1-10ms per sync
    - **Batching**: Group commits for efficiency
  </Card>

  <Card title="Recovery Speed" icon="forward-slash">
    - **Read speed**: 500+ MB/s (sequential)
    - **Recovery time**: ~1 second per GB
    - **Parallel replay**: Modern DBs use multiple threads
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Common Implementation Patterns

### 1. Group Commit

Instead of syncing after every write, batch multiple writes:

```rust
// Inefficient: sync per write
for entry in entries {
    wal.append(&entry)?;
    wal.sync()?; // Slow!
}

// Efficient: group commit
for entry in entries {
    wal.append(&entry)?;
}
wal.sync()?; // One sync for all!
```

### 2. Checkpointing

Periodically save a snapshot to avoid replaying entire history:

```text
WAL: [Entry1][Entry2][Entry3][CHECKPOINT][Entry4][Entry5]
                              ↑
                    Recovery starts here, not at Entry1
```

### 3. Log Recycling

Reuse old log files to avoid filesystem overhead:

```text
wal.000001.log (full) → Archive or delete
wal.000002.log (active) → Current writes
wal.000003.log (preallocated) → Ready for next rotation
```

## Production Considerations

### Configuration Options

```toml
[wal]
sync_mode = "always"     # always | periodic | never
sync_interval_ms = 100   # If periodic
max_file_size_mb = 128   # When to rotate
compression = "none"     # none | snappy | zstd
```

### Monitoring Metrics

- **WAL write latency**: Should be < 10ms
- **WAL size**: Monitor growth rate
- **Recovery time**: Test regularly
- **Sync failures**: Must be zero!

## Common Pitfalls

<Aside type="danger" title="Pitfall: Forgetting to Sync">
  **Problem**: Writing to WAL without fsync **Result**: OS buffers data, crash loses it anyway
  **Solution**: Always call fsync/fdatasync after critical writes
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Pitfall: Corrupted Entries">
  **Problem**: Partial write during crash **Result**: Can't deserialize, recovery fails
  **Solution**: Use checksums, length prefixes, or sentinel values
</Aside>

## Testing Your Understanding

<Card title="Quick Quiz" icon="puzzle">

1. Why must we sync after WAL writes?
2. What happens if power fails during a WAL write?
3. How does group commit improve performance?
4. When can we safely delete old WAL files?

</Card>

## Hands-On Exercise

Try implementing a simple WAL:

```rust
struct SimpleWAL {
    file: File,
    entries: Vec<LogEntry>,
}

impl SimpleWAL {
    fn append(&mut self, key: &str, value: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Your code here:
        // 1. Create LogEntry
        // 2. Serialize to bytes
        // 3. Write to file
        // 4. Sync to disk
    }

    fn recover(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Your code here:
        // 1. Read entries from file
        // 2. Deserialize each one
        // 3. Apply to state
    }
}
```

### Additional Exercises

**Exercise 3**: Test crash recovery

```bash
# Start a write workload
cargo run --example wal_stress_test &

# Kill it mid-write (simulating crash)
sleep 5 && kill -9 $!

# Run recovery
cargo run --example wal_recovery -- --recover-from test.wal
```

### Debugging & Observability

**Key metrics to watch:**

- **WAL size**: Monitor growth rate and truncation frequency
- **Sync latency**: Time spent in `fsync()` calls
- **Recovery duration**: Time to replay WAL after crash

**Debugging techniques:**

- **WAL inspection**: `cargo run --bin wal-dump` to examine entries
- **Corruption detection**: Look for CRC mismatches in logs
- **Performance profiling**: Measure time spent in WAL operations

## Real-World Context

### Industry Comparison

How other databases handle WAL:

| Database       | WAL Implementation         | Key Features              |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL     | WAL with configurable sync | Full ACID compliance      |
| MySQL (InnoDB) | Redo log                   | Group commit optimization |
| SQLite         | Journal or WAL mode        | Simpler for embedded use  |
| Redis          | AOF (Append Only File)     | Optional durability       |

### Historical Evolution

<Steps>

1. **1992**: ARIES paper establishes WAL principles
2. **2004**: SQLite adds WAL mode for better concurrency
3. **2010**: NoSQL databases adopt WAL for durability
4. **Today**: NVMe and persistent memory changing WAL design

</Steps>

## Production Pitfalls & Solutions

<Aside type="danger" title="Pitfall: Forgetting to sync">
  **Problem**: Data in OS buffer not on disk **Solution**: Always call `fsync()` for durability
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Pitfall: Corrupted WAL handling">
  **Problem**: Single bit flip makes entry unreadable **Solution**: CRC checksums and length
  prefixes
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Pitfall: Unbounded growth">
  **Problem**: WAL fills up disk **Solution**: Regular checkpointing and truncation
</Aside>

### Production Considerations

**Operational concerns:**

- **Disk monitoring**: WAL can fill disk quickly under high load
- **Sync tuning**: Balance durability vs performance for your use case
- **Backup strategy**: Include WAL in backups for point-in-time recovery
- **Separate disks**: Put WAL on different disk than data for better I/O

## Summary

### Core Concepts Learned

1. **Write-ahead principle ensures durability**: Log before modifying data structures
2. **Sequential writes are fast**: Appending to log much faster than random updates
3. **Recovery is straightforward**: Just replay the log from last checkpoint

### When to Apply This Knowledge

- **Use WAL when**: Data durability is critical (financial transactions, user data)
- **Consider alternatives when**: Data can be regenerated or loss is acceptable
- **Implementation complexity**: Moderate - requires careful handling of I/O and recovery
