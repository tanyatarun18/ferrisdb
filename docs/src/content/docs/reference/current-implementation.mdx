<Aside type="tip">
  This document describes what we've ACTUALLY implemented, not what we plan to build. For our vision
  and plans, see [Future Architecture](/reference/future-architecture/).
</Aside>

## What Exists Today

We've implemented three core components of an LSM-tree storage engine, but they're not yet integrated into a working system.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Write-Ahead Log (WAL) ✅

We have a complete WAL implementation that ensures durability.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What Works">
    - Binary format with little-endian encoding
    - CRC32 checksums for corruption detection
    - Configurable sync modes (None, Normal, Full)
    - Size-based rotation (returns error when limit reached)
    - Proper error handling and recovery
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Implementation">
    ```rust
    // Actual format we use
    pub struct WALEntry {
        pub key: Vec<u8>,
        pub value: Option<Vec<u8>>,  // None for deletes
        pub timestamp: u64,
        pub operation: Operation,
    }
    
    // Binary layout: [length:4][crc:4][data:varies]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Code Location">
    - `ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/writer.rs` - Writes entries
    - `ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/reader.rs` - Reads and recovers
    - `ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/log_entry.rs` - Entry format
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. MemTable (Skip List) ✅

We have a concurrent skip list that serves as our in-memory write buffer.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Features Implemented" icon="approve-check">
    - Lock-free reads using crossbeam epoch - Fine-grained locking for writes - MVCC with timestamp
    ordering - Max height of 12 levels - ~450 lines of tested code
  </Card>

  <Card title="Performance Characteristics" icon="rocket">
    - O(log n) insert/lookup - Concurrent reads don't block - Keys ordered by (user_key, timestamp
    DESC) - No size limit enforcement yet
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### 3. SSTable Writer ✅

We can write sorted data to disk in SSTable format.

```text
Our SSTable Format:
┌─────────────┐
│ Data Blocks │ - Series of sorted entries
├─────────────┤
│ Index Block │ - First key of each data block
├─────────────┤
│ Bloom Filter│ - Placeholder (just zeros)
├─────────────┤
│   Footer    │ - Offsets and checksums
└─────────────┘
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The SSTable Reader exists but is NOT functional. We can write SSTables but can't read them back
  yet.
</Aside>

## What's NOT Implemented

### Missing Core Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SSTable Reader" icon="cancel">
    - Structure defined - Cannot actually read files - No block cache - No bloom filter support
  </Card>

<Card title="Storage Engine" icon="cancel">
  - Components not integrated - No flush from MemTable to SSTable - No read path implementation - No
  manifest/version tracking
</Card>

  <Card title="Compaction" icon="cancel">
    - No background threads - No merging of SSTables - No garbage collection - No level management
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Missing Infrastructure

- **No Server** - Can't accept network connections
- **No Client** - Can't connect to a database
- **No API** - No way to get/put data
- **No Configuration** - Hardcoded values only

## Code Statistics

```bash
# Component sizes (excluding tests)
WAL:           ~500 lines
MemTable:      ~450 lines
SSTable Writer: ~650 lines
SSTable Reader: ~200 lines (non-functional)
Core Types:    ~200 lines
---
Total:         ~2,000 lines of actual implementation
```

## You Can Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb
cd ferrisdb

# Run component tests
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage

# Specific component tests
cargo test wal::    # WAL tests
cargo test memtable # MemTable tests
cargo test sstable  # SSTable tests
```

## You Cannot Run

```bash
# These don't exist:
ferrisdb-server           # No server binary
ferrisdb-client connect   # No client
ferrisdb bench            # No benchmarks
ferrisdb --config         # No configuration
```

## Current Architecture Reality

Instead of the distributed system in our vision, here's what actually exists:

```text
What We Have:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     Individual Components   │
│  ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌───────┐ │
│  │ WAL │ │MemT│ │SSTable│ │
│  └─────┘ └─────┘ └───────┘ │
│   (not connected together)  │
└─────────────────────────────┘

What We Don't Have:
- Storage Engine connecting them
- Network layer
- Transaction system
- Distribution/replication
- Query processing
```

## Honest Assessment

### What's Good

- Clean, well-tested component implementations
- Good foundation for learning
- Real concurrent data structures
- Proper error handling

### What's Missing

- Components aren't integrated
- Can't actually store/retrieve data
- No persistence beyond WAL
- Long way from a "database"

### For Learners

This is **perfect** if you want to:

- Understand how databases work internally
- See real concurrent Rust code
- Follow a database being built from scratch
- Learn alongside us

This is **not** for you if you need:

- A working database
- Production storage
- Benchmarkable performance
- Distributed features

## Next Steps

Watch our journey as we:

1. Make SSTable Reader actually work
2. Connect components into a storage engine
3. Add a simple get/put API
4. Build from there!
