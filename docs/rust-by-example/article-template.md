ARTICLE TEMPLATE: Rust by Example - Database Edition

This template ensures consistency across all comparison articles.
Follow this structure for every article in the series.

TARGET AUDIENCE: CRUD developers who know programming but are new to Rust
GOAL: Help them understand Rust through real FerrisDB code examples
-->

## The Problem We're Solving

<!--
Explain WHAT we're trying to accomplish in FerrisDB with this code.
Use simple, concrete terms that any programmer would understand.
Focus on the business/technical requirement, not the implementation.

Example: "We need to store key-value pairs in memory and ensure multiple threads
can read and write safely without corrupting data."
-->

[Explain the specific problem this code solves in FerrisDB]

## The Rust Solution

<!--
Show the actual Rust code from FerrisDB with clear explanations.
Break down each part for someone who's never seen Rust.
Explain WHY Rust does things this way.
-->

Let's look at how FerrisDB handles this in Rust:

```rust
// Actual code from FerrisDB with file reference
// ferrisdb-storage/src/[component]/[file].rs:[line-range]

[Insert actual Rust code here]
```

**What's happening here:**

1. **[Concept 1]**: [Explain this Rust feature in simple terms]
2. **[Concept 2]**: [Explain why Rust requires this]
3. **[Concept 3]**: [Connect to the business problem]

**Key Rust Concepts:**

- **[Feature]**: [Simple explanation]
- **[Feature]**: [Why it matters for this use case]

## How Other Languages Handle This

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript
// Equivalent implementation in JavaScript
[Insert JavaScript code that solves the same problem]
```

**Key Differences:**

- ✅ **Simpler syntax**: [Explain what's easier]
- ⚠️ **Runtime safety**: [Explain what can go wrong]
- 🤔 **Performance**: [Memory usage, garbage collection, etc]

### Python

```python
# Equivalent implementation in Python
[Insert Python code that solves the same problem]
```

**Key Differences:**

- ✅ **Readability**: [What makes Python more readable]
- ⚠️ **Performance**: [Speed/memory concerns]
- 🤔 **Concurrency**: [GIL limitations, threading issues]

### Java

```java
// Equivalent implementation in Java
[Insert Java code that solves the same problem]
```

**Key Differences:**

- ✅ **Familiar patterns**: [OOP, interfaces, etc]
- ⚠️ **Verbosity**: [Boilerplate code]
- 🤔 **Memory management**: [GC pauses, object overhead]

### Go

```go
// Equivalent implementation in Go
[Insert Go code that solves the same problem]
```

**Key Differences:**

- ✅ **Simplicity**: [Easier concurrency, simpler syntax]
- ⚠️ **Safety**: [Nil pointer risks, data races]
- 🤔 **Performance**: [GC overhead, interface costs]

## Rust's Trade-offs: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

### 🚀 Where Rust Excels

1. **[Benefit 1]**: [Concrete example from the code]

   - In our case: [Specific advantage in FerrisDB]

2. **[Benefit 2]**: [Another advantage]
   - Real impact: [Measurable benefit]

### 😤 Where Rust is Harder

1. **[Challenge 1]**: [What makes this difficult]

   - Learning curve: [Specific concepts that are hard]

2. **[Challenge 2]**: [Development complexity]
   - Trade-off: [What you give up for safety/performance]

### 🤷 When Other Languages Might Be Better

- **For rapid prototyping**: [Language] because [reason]
- **For simple CRUD apps**: [Language] because [reason]
- **For team with specific expertise**: [Language] because [reason]

## Real-World Impact in FerrisDB

<!--
Show concrete measurements, benchmarks, or benefits.
Make it tangible - how does this Rust approach help FerrisDB?
-->

**Performance Benefits:**

- Specific metric: [Measurement]
- Memory usage: [Comparison]

**Safety Benefits:**

- [Bug category]: [How Rust prevents it]
- [Concurrency issue]: [How ownership rules help]

## Try It Yourself

<!--
Provide a simple exercise for readers to experiment with.
Keep it focused on the concept being taught.
-->

**Exercise**: [Simple task using this concept]

```rust
// Starter code
[Basic template for reader to modify]
```

**Bonus**: Try implementing the same logic in your preferred language and compare:

- How many lines of code?
- What safety guarantees do you get/lose?
- How would you handle the concurrency aspects?
