Learn Rust through real database code - explained for CRUD developers
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Welcome to **Rust by Example: Database Edition** - a comprehensive guide to understanding Rust through real, production-quality database code from FerrisDB.

## Who This Is For

**Target audience**: Developers who know programming (especially CRUD development) but are new to Rust.

If you've built web apps, REST APIs, or worked with databases in JavaScript, Python, Java, or Go, this series is designed for you. We'll teach Rust concepts by showing you how FerrisDB solves real database problems, then comparing the solutions with languages you already know.

## Article Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: First Rust concepts (ownership, borrowing, Result types). Comparisons focus on syntax differences.
- **Intermediate**: Rust patterns and idioms (traits, generics). Comparisons include performance implications.
- **Advanced**: Complex Rust features (lifetimes, unsafe, macros). Deep performance and memory comparisons.

## Why Database Code?

Database systems showcase Rust's strengths perfectly:

- **Memory safety** matters when handling user data
- **Performance** is critical for high-throughput systems
- **Concurrency** is essential for multi-user databases
- **System programming** concepts are practical, not academic

Instead of toy examples, you'll see how Rust's features solve actual engineering challenges in a real database.

## Article Format

Every article follows the same structure:

1. **The Problem**: What we're trying to solve in FerrisDB
2. **Rust Solution**: Real code with detailed explanations
3. **Language Comparisons**: Same solution in JavaScript, Python, Java, Go
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: Where Rust excels and where it's harder
5. **Real Impact**: Concrete benefits in FerrisDB
6. **Try It**: Hands-on exercise
