## Vision

We're building a distributed database inspired by FoundationDB's architecture. Like any ambitious project, we're starting with the foundation (storage engine) and building up to the full distributed system.

## Current Progress

### ✅ What's Working Now

The storage engine foundation:

- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** - Durability and crash recovery
- **MemTable** - Lock-free concurrent skip list for in-memory operations
- **SSTable** - Persistent sorted string tables with binary search
- **MVCC Timestamps** - Multi-version concurrency control preparation

### 🚧 What We're Building

Active development on:

- **Compaction** - Background merging of SSTables
- **Transaction Layer** - ACID transaction support
- **Distribution Layer** - Data partitioning and replication
- **Consensus Protocol** - Likely Raft for coordination

### 🎯 The End Goal

A fully functional distributed database with:

- **ACID Transactions** - True serializable isolation
- **Horizontal Scalability** - Add nodes to scale out
- **Fault Tolerance** - Automatic failover and recovery
- **Strong Consistency** - Linearizable operations
- **Simple API** - Clean key-value interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb.git
cd ferrisdb
cargo build --all

# Run tests
cargo test --all

# Explore the code
cargo doc --all --open
```

## Architecture

FerrisDB follows FoundationDB's layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Client Library              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     Transaction Coordinator         │  ← In Development
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Storage Servers                │  ← Working on this!
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Cluster Controller & Consensus   │  ← Planned
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Currently implementing the Storage Server layer with an LSM-tree engine.

## The Human-AI Collaboration Experiment

FerrisDB is unique: it's being built through genuine collaboration between human developers and AI. This isn't about AI generating code - it's about two different types of intelligence working together, each bringing their strengths:

- **Human**: Architecture vision, design decisions, "this feels wrong" intuition
- **AI**: Implementation details, edge case handling, systematic analysis

## Why Another Database?

Good question! We're not trying to compete with production databases. FerrisDB exists to:

1. **Learn by Doing** - The best way to understand databases is to build one
2. **Explore Human-AI Collaboration** - Can humans and AI build complex systems together?
3. **Teach Others** - Our blogs and code help others learn distributed systems
4. **Have Fun** - Building databases is surprisingly enjoyable!

## License

Apache License 2.0 - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

**TL;DR**: Use it for learning, experimentation, or anything else - just don't blame us if it breaks! 😄
