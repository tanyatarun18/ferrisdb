## Introduction

FerrisDB is designed for educational purposes. It provides a hands-on experience with distributed database concepts. You will explore the underlying mechanics of LSM-trees, learn about Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), and understand how distributed systems operate. 

This project is built in Rust, a language known for its performance and safety. If you are interested in databases or distributed systems, FerrisDB is an excellent starting point.

## Features

- **Educational Focus**: Designed to help you learn about distributed databases.
- **LSM-trees**: Implement LSM-trees for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **MVCC**: Understand and implement Multi-Version Concurrency Control.
- **Rust**: Written in Rust, ensuring safety and performance.
- **Distributed Systems**: Gain insights into the workings of distributed databases.

## Installation

To get started with FerrisDB, you need to clone the repository and build the project. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanyatarun18/ferrisdb.git
   cd ferrisdb
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use FerrisDB to experiment with distributed database concepts. The primary entry point is the `main.rs` file, where you can modify and extend the functionality.

To run a specific example or test, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute:

```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

## Architecture

FerrisDB's architecture is based on several key components:

### LSM-trees

Log-Structured Merge-trees (LSM-trees) are used for efficient data storage. They optimize write operations and minimize disk I/O. 

### MVCC

Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) allows multiple versions of data to coexist. This ensures that read operations do not block write operations, enhancing performance.

### Distributed System Design

FerrisDB employs a distributed architecture, allowing data to be spread across multiple nodes. This design improves scalability and fault tolerance.
