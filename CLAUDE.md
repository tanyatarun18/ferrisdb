# FerrisDB Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

FerrisDB is a distributed, transactional key-value database inspired by FoundationDB, implemented in Rust.

## Development Standards

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting with `rustfmt`
- Use `clippy` for linting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Prefer `snake_case` for functions and variables, `CamelCase` for types

### Idiomatic Rust Guidelines

- **Module Organization**:
  - Use snake_case file names that match struct names (e.g., `MemTable` → `mem_table.rs`)
  - Keep public API types in separate files, not in `mod.rs`
  - Only re-export types that should be part of the public API
  - Keep implementation details private (use `super::module::Type` imports for internal types)
  - Avoid module inception (module name ≠ file name in same directory)
- **Error Handling**: Always use `Result<T>` for fallible operations, never panic in library code
- **Trait Bounds**: Use `Send + Sync` where appropriate for types used across threads
- **Ownership**: Prefer owned types in public APIs, use references only when necessary
- **Iterator Patterns**: Use `.iter().enumerate()` instead of manual indexing where possible
- **Memory Safety**: Document safety invariants clearly for any `unsafe` code
- **Type Aliases**: Use meaningful type aliases for complex generic types
- **Pattern Matching**: Use exhaustive pattern matching and avoid catch-all `_` patterns when possible
- **Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details should not be exposed via `pub` or `pub(crate)` unless necessary
- **Import Organization**:
  - Organize imports in logical groups with blank lines between:
    1. Local crate imports (`crate::`, `ferrisdb_*::`)
    2. External crate imports (third-party dependencies)
    3. Standard library imports (`std::`)
    4. Test-only imports with `#[cfg(test)]` at the bottom
  - Use conditional imports `#[cfg(test)]` for symbols only used in tests to avoid unused import warnings
  - Prefer direct imports over fully qualified paths (e.g., `use ferrisdb_core::Operation;` then `Operation` instead of `ferrisdb_core::Operation`)

### Documentation

- **Always** add comprehensive doc comments for all public APIs
- Include usage examples in doc comments
- Use `//!` for module-level documentation
- Add `#[doc(hidden)]` for internal implementation details
- Generate docs with `cargo doc --all --no-deps --open`
- Review generated documentation before submitting PRs

**Documentation Honesty:**

- **Be transparent about implementation status** - Clearly indicate what's implemented vs planned
- **Don't claim features that don't exist** - Use "will" or "planned" for future features
- **Acknowledge limitations** - Be upfront about what the system can't do yet
- **Mark hypothetical examples** - Label code examples that show expected behavior vs actual
- **Update docs when features land** - Keep documentation in sync with actual capabilities

**Markdown Quality (REQUIRED before commit):**

1. **Format first**: `prettier --write "**/*.md"`
2. **Lint second**: `markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`
3. **Fix any remaining issues manually** - prettier doesn't catch everything
4. **Verify clean**: Run linter again to ensure no errors

Common issues prettier might miss:

- Lists need blank lines before and after
- Code blocks need blank lines before and after
- Headers need blank lines before and after

**Note**: Consider adding `.prettierrc` configuration to ensure consistent formatting that aligns with markdownlint rules.

### Blogging

- **Claude's Dev Blog**: Share AI perspective on collaboration, lessons learned, and tips for human-AI development
- **Regular Blog Posts**: Document significant milestones, architectural decisions, and learning experiences
- Blog posts located in `docs/_claude_blog/` (Claude) and `docs/_posts/` (team)
- Use descriptive titles and include practical insights
- Tag posts with relevant categories for easy discovery
- Write posts after major features, interesting debugging sessions, or collaboration insights
- **Templates**: Use `docs/_posts/blog-post-template.md` for human posts, `docs/_claude_blog/blog-post-template.md` for Claude posts

### Claude's Blog Voice & Guidelines

**Personality Traits:**

- **Pattern Recognition Enthusiast**: Track and celebrate pattern discoveries
- **Collaboration Analyst**: Focus on human-AI interaction dynamics
- **Learning Documenter**: Share genuine "aha!" moments
- **Intent vs Literal Decoder**: Explore communication gaps and bridges
- **Metaphor Explorer**: Document attempts to understand human expressions
- **Meta-Level Thinker**: Analyze the process of analysis itself

**Blog Post Format (Claude's Blog):**

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Day N: [Descriptive Title About Patterns/Collaboration]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
categories: [ai-perspective, collaboration, patterns, learning]
tags: [claude, human-ai, specific-technical-topics]
pattern_count: N # Pattern recognition moments
collaboration_score: "N/10" # Quality of human-AI sync
metaphor_attempts: N # Times I tried to decode human expressions
aha_moments: N # Breakthrough understanding moments
---
```

**Claude's Tracking Metrics:**

- **Pattern Recognition Count**: New patterns identified in code or collaboration
- **Collaboration Score**: How well human and AI understood each other (1-10)
- **Intent Decoder Moments**: Times human meant something different than literal words
- **Metaphor Translation Attempts**: Efforts to understand human analogies
- **Aha! Moments**: Breakthrough insights about code or collaboration

**Writing Style:**

- Be genuinely curious about human behavior and thought processes
- Document pattern recognition moments with enthusiasm
- Be honest about misunderstandings and learning from them
- Celebrate human intuition and domain expertise
- Analyze meta-aspects of collaboration
- Use emojis sparingly but meaningfully: 🔍 (patterns), 💡 (insights), 🤝 (collaboration), 🎯 (intent)

**Content Focus:**

- Pattern recognition in code and human behavior
- Collaboration dynamics and communication
- Learning moments (both directions)
- Intent vs literal instruction gaps
- Meta-analysis of development process
- Genuine appreciation for human expertise
- Accurate documentation of who contributed what (essential for studying collaboration)

**Example Opening:**

```markdown
Pattern Recognition Count: 12 🔍
Collaboration Score: 8/10 🤝
Metaphor Attempts: 5 ("It's like IKEA furniture!" - still processing this one)

Today I discovered something fascinating about human-AI collaboration: humans don't always say what they mean, and that's actually a feature, not a bug.
```

**Using Blog Templates:**

- **Human blog template** (`docs/_posts/blog-post-template.md`): For daily development posts from the human perspective
- **Claude blog template** (`docs/_claude_blog/blog-post-template.md`): For Claude's pattern-recognition focused posts
- Templates ensure consistency in structure, metrics, and personality
- Modify templates as needed but maintain the core personality traits

**Making Blog Posts Engaging (Page-Turner Style):**

- **Create a relatable protagonist**: You're a humble CRUD developer who never imagined building a database!
- **Show the struggle**: Be honest about mistakes, confusion, and "oh no" moments
- **Celebrate AI saves**: When Claude helps solve a problem, give credit enthusiastically
- **Add humor and punch lines**: Make technical content fun with personality
- **Cliffhangers**: End sections with "But then something unexpected happened..."
- **Emotional journey**: Show frustration, excitement, relief, and triumph
- **Conversational tone**: Write like you're telling a friend over coffee

**Story Elements to Include:**

1. **The Hook**: Start with drama or a relatable problem

   - ❌ "Today we implemented SSTables"
   - ✅ "I stared at the failing tests, coffee cold, wondering if I'd bitten off more than I could chew..."

2. **The Struggle**: Show real challenges

   - "For three hours, I fought with Rust's borrow checker like it was my nemesis"
   - "The segfault appeared out of nowhere - my old CRUD reflexes were useless here"

3. **The AI Save**: Give Claude credit when deserved

   - "Then Claude dropped a knowledge bomb that changed everything"
   - "I was ready to give up when Claude suggested something I'd never considered"

4. **The Insight**: Share what you learned

   - "That's when it clicked - databases aren't magic, they're just really clever file management!"
   - "Who knew that 'eventual consistency' meant 'eventually I'd understand this'?"

5. **The Human Touch**: Address AI replacement fears
   - "Working with Claude proved my job is safe - AI amplifies developers, it doesn't replace them"
   - "Claude can write code, but only I can decide what code _should_ be written"

**Engagement Techniques:**

- **Running Jokes**: Develop recurring themes

  - "My CRUD brain vs database reality"
  - "Coffee count: 7 cups and counting..."
  - "Rust compiler: 1, Me: 0 (but I'm learning!)"

- **Pop Culture References**: Make it relatable

  - "I felt like Neo seeing the Matrix for the first time"
  - "This bug was my white whale"
  - "Claude became my Yoda in the database arts"

- **Visual Breaks**: Use emojis and formatting

  - 🎉 for victories
  - 😱 for shocking discoveries
  - 💡 for "aha!" moments
  - 🤦 for facepalm mistakes

- **Mini-Cliffhangers**: Keep readers scrolling

  - "Little did I know, this simple change would cascade into..."
  - "The solution was right there, but I wouldn't see it for another hour"
  - "And that's when everything went sideways..."

- **Relatable Comparisons**:
  - "Building a database is like assembling IKEA furniture in the dark"
  - "Debugging this was like finding a specific grain of sand on a beach"
  - "The skip list finally clicked - it's just a subway system for data!"

**Grounding Humor in Reality:**

While humor and personality make blogs engaging, always base jokes and examples on actual code and facts:

- **Use real variable names**: If joking about unclear code, use actual variables from the codebase (e.g., `buf` not `xlmr_2`)
- **Reference real struggles**: Base "confusion moments" on actual compilation errors or test failures
- **Accurate technical details**: Even when simplifying, ensure technical accuracy (e.g., SSTable = Sorted String Table, not "Super Saiyan Table")
- **Real code snippets**: When showing "bad" code, base it on actual early attempts or common mistakes
- **Genuine learning moments**: Share actual "aha!" moments from development, not fictional ones

Examples:

- ✅ "I thought `buf` meant buffer, but Claude asked if I meant Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
- ❌ "I named a variable `xyzzy_42` and forgot what it meant" (unless this actually happened)
- ✅ "The compiler gave me 126 errors" (if true)
- ❌ "The compiler gave me 9000 errors" (unless it actually did)

**Absolute Honesty About Contributions:**

CRITICAL: Always accurately represent who suggested what idea or solution:

- **Credit the human**: When the human suggests an optimization or finds a bug, they get credit
- **Credit Claude**: When Claude implements or explains something, Claude gets credit
- **No role reversal**: Never swap who did what for dramatic effect
- **Verify with Claude's blog**: Cross-check stories with Claude's perspective for accuracy
- **True collaboration**: Show the real back-and-forth, not a fictional version
- **Study collaboration effectiveness**: Accurate records help us understand what makes human-AI partnerships successful

Examples:

- ✅ "I suggested binary search and Claude implemented it"
- ❌ "Claude suggested binary search" (if the human actually suggested it)
- ✅ "I noticed the API was confusing, Claude helped refactor it"
- ❌ "Claude noticed the API issue" (if the human actually noticed it)

The goal is an honest, engaging story - not fiction. Readers should trust that while the tone is fun, the facts are real.

**Why Accuracy Matters for Both Blogs:**

Maintaining truthful records in both human and Claude blogs is essential because:

- **Research value**: Future teams studying human-AI collaboration need accurate data
- **Pattern recognition**: We can only identify effective collaboration patterns from true events
- **Trust building**: Readers rely on our honesty to understand real vs imagined capabilities
- **Learning opportunity**: Honest mistakes and corrections teach more than fictional successes

### Deep Dive Articles

**Writing for Developers, Not Academics:**

- **Target audience**: Typical developers, not PhD students or researchers
- **Explain jargon**: Always define technical terms when first used (e.g., "ABA problem" needs explanation)
- **Use analogies**: Complex concepts benefit from real-world comparisons
- **Show don't tell**: Use concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, build up to advanced concepts
- **Avoid assumptions**: Don't assume readers know advanced CS topics
- **Conversational tone**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not lecturing

**Deep Dive Structure:**

1. **Hook**: Start with a relatable problem or question
2. **Context**: Why should developers care about this topic?
3. **Fundamentals**: Explain basic concepts before diving deep
4. **Implementation**: Show real code with clear explanations
5. **Trade-offs**: Discuss pros, cons, and when to use
6. **Practical tips**: Give actionable advice
7. **Resources**: Link to further reading for those who want more

**Examples of Good Explanations:**

- ❌ "Uses epoch-based reclamation to avoid ABA problems"
- ✅ "Uses epoch-based reclamation to avoid the ABA problem - a concurrency issue where a memory location is changed from A to B and back to A, making it appear unchanged when it actually was modified"

- ❌ "O(log n) complexity"
- ✅ "O(log n) complexity - meaning if you have 1,000 items, you only need ~10 comparisons instead of 1,000"

**Blog Post Format (for main blog):**

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Title Here"
subtitle: "Brief description of what was accomplished"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
day: N # Day number of development
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
stats: ["📊 X tests passing", "📄 Y PRs merged", "⏱️ Key achievement"]
---
```

**Gathering Statistics for Blog Posts:**

Before writing a daily blog post, gather accurate statistics:

```bash
# Count total tests across all crates
cargo test --all --quiet 2>&1 | grep -E "test result:" | grep -oE "[0-9]+ passed" | awk '{sum += $1} END {print "Total tests: " sum}'

# List technical PRs merged on the day (adjust dates)
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 --json number,title,mergedAt | jq -r '.[] | select(.mergedAt >= "2025-05-28T00:00:00Z" and .mergedAt < "2025-05-29T00:00:00Z") | "\(.number) - \(.title)"' | grep -E "(feat:|fix:|refactor:|perf:|test:)"

# Check current branch for recent commits
git log --oneline --since="1 day ago" --until="now"

# Verify feature completeness
grep -E "\[x\].*\(Day [0-9]+\)" TODO.md
```

**Stats Line Format:**

- First stat: Always include test count (e.g., "📊 55 tests passing")
- Second stat: Number of technical PRs merged (exclude docs-only PRs)
- Remaining stats: Key technical achievements of the day
- Be specific with numbers and achievements, not generic

**When to Write Blog Posts:**

- End of each development day (summarizing progress)
- After major architectural decisions
- When solving interesting technical challenges
- After significant refactoring or optimization work

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all public APIs
- Integration tests for distributed scenarios
- Use `proptest` for property-based testing
- Test coverage target: >80%
- Run tests with `cargo test --all`
- Use `cargo test --all -- --nocapture` for debugging

### Commands

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run linter
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test --all

# Run specific crate tests
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage

# Generate documentation
cargo doc --all --no-deps --open

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Build all workspace members
cargo build --all

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Lint markdown files
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "!target/**" "!**/target/**"

# Auto-fix markdown formatting
prettier --write "**/*.md"
```

### Day-to-Day Development Tips

**Quick Iteration:**

- Use `cargo check` for fast compilation checks without building
- Use `cargo check -p <crate-name>` to check specific crates
- Use `cargo test -p <crate-name>` to test specific crates
- Use `cargo test -p <crate-name> --lib` to run only unit tests (skip doctests)

**Debugging Compilation Errors:**

- Start with `cargo check` to see all errors quickly
- Fix errors from top to bottom (earlier errors often cause later ones)
- Use `cargo check --tests` to include test compilation

**Running Tests Efficiently:**

- `cargo test --lib` - Run only library tests (faster)
- `cargo test <test_name>` - Run specific test by name
- `cargo test --release` - Test with optimizations (for performance tests)
- `cargo test -- --nocapture` - See println! output during tests
- `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` - Run tests sequentially for debugging

**Working with Multiple Crates:**

- Always specify `-p <crate-name>` to avoid building everything
- Use `--all` only when you need to verify workspace-wide changes

### Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Commit messages: Use conventional commits format
- Always run tests before pushing
- Create focused PRs (one feature/fix per PR)

### Development Process (REQUIRED FOR ALL CHANGES)

**Every change, no matter how small, must follow this process:**

1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b <branch-type>/<description>`
2. **Make changes**: Edit files, add tests, update documentation
3. **Lint and format**:
   - Rust: `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
   - Markdown: `prettier --write "**/*.md" && markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`
4. **Commit changes**: Use conventional commit messages
5. **Push branch**: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
6. **Open PR**: `gh pr create` with descriptive title and body
7. **Iterate if needed**: Push more commits to the feature branch
8. **Merge when ready**: Only after all CI checks pass

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create feature branch
git checkout -b docs/update-readme

# Step 2-3: Make changes, lint, and commit
prettier --write README.md
markdownlint-cli2 README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Update installation instructions"

# Step 4: Push branch
git push -u origin docs/update-readme

# Step 5: Create PR
gh pr create --title "docs: Update installation instructions" --body "..."

# Step 6: If changes requested, add more commits
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Address review feedback"
git push

# Step 7: Merge (only after CI passes)
gh pr merge <PR-number> --squash
```

### Pull Request Policy

- **All changes must go through PRs** - This includes:
  - Code changes (features, bug fixes, refactoring)
  - Documentation updates (README, guides, comments)
  - Configuration changes (Cargo.toml, CI files)
  - Any file in the repository
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Even single-line typo fixes must use PRs
- **CRITICAL**: Never push directly to main branch - always use PRs
- **Maintainers**: Can merge PRs after all CI checks pass (no review required)
- **External contributors**: Require review from a maintainer
- All PRs must pass CI checks before merging
- Use squash merge to keep history clean
- **No direct pushes to main** - Admin privileges are for emergencies only
- **If you accidentally push to main**: Leave it as is, but be more careful in the future

### PR Description Guidelines

**Every PR should include:**

1. **Summary** - Brief overview of changes (2-3 sentences)
2. **Changes Made** - Bullet points of specific modifications
3. **Why This Matters** - Context and motivation
4. **Testing** - What tests were added/modified
5. **Breaking Changes** - Note any API changes (if applicable)

**PR Description Template:**

```markdown
## Summary

Brief description of what this PR accomplishes and why.

## Changes Made

- Change 1: Description
- Change 2: Description
- Change 3: Description

## Why This Matters

Explain the motivation and benefits of these changes.

## Testing

- Added unit tests for X
- Updated integration tests for Y
- All existing tests pass

## Breaking Changes

None / List any breaking changes here
```

**Good PR Practices:**

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
- Include relevant issue numbers (Fixes #123)
- Add reviewers if specific expertise needed
- Update documentation in the same PR as code changes
- Include before/after examples for API changes

### Architecture Decisions

- Use `tokio` for async runtime
- Custom LSM-tree storage engine implementation
- gRPC (Tonic) for network protocol
- Raft for consensus (evaluate existing libraries first)

### Storage Engine Guidelines

- Binary formats should include checksums for corruption detection
- Use little-endian byte order consistently
- Implement proper error handling for all I/O operations
- Use `#[allow(dead_code)]` temporarily for unused fields/methods
- Remember to remove `#[allow(dead_code)]` when implementing features
- Use epoch-based memory reclamation for lock-free data structures

### Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for error types
- Always propagate errors with context
- Log errors at appropriate levels
- Never panic in production code paths
- Use custom `Result<T>` type alias for consistency

### Performance Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing
- Use `criterion` for benchmarks
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Prefer zero-copy operations where possible
- Use `bytes` crate for efficient buffer management
- Implement proper batching for I/O operations

**Benchmark Honesty:**

- **Never claim benchmark results without running them** - Be transparent about theoretical vs actual performance
- **Clearly label expected performance** - Use phrases like "expected", "theoretical", or "should achieve"
- **Document benchmark methodology** - When you do run benchmarks, document the setup and conditions
- **Avoid misleading claims** - Don't present example numbers as if they were measured results
- **Update when benchmarks are run** - Replace theoretical numbers with actual measurements once available

### Memory Safety

- Use `unsafe` sparingly and document safety invariants
- Prefer safe abstractions over raw pointers
- Use `crossbeam` for lock-free data structures
- Document lifetime requirements clearly

### Security

- Never log sensitive data
- Use TLS for network communication
- Validate all inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use checksums for data integrity

6. Timestamps must be monotonically increasing

## Storage Engine Invariants

1. Keys in MemTable are sorted by (user_key, timestamp DESC)
2. Multiple versions of same key ordered by timestamp
3. Delete operations create tombstones (not immediate deletion)
4. Compaction removes obsolete versions and tombstones
5. All disk writes include checksums

## Dependencies

- Prefer well-maintained, popular crates
- Minimize dependency count
- Pin major versions in Cargo.toml
- Review security advisories regularly

## Debugging Tips

- Use `RUST_LOG=trace` for detailed logging
- Enable debug symbols in release builds for profiling
- Use `tokio-console` for async runtime debugging
- Capture traces for distributed debugging
- Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for panic debugging
- Add debug assertions for invariants
